# Collaborative Filtering for Laptop Recommender System

This document describes the implementation of collaborative filtering algorithms for the Laptop Recommender System, which complements the existing content-based filtering approach.

## Overview

The collaborative filtering module implements multiple recommendation approaches that analyze user-item interactions and patterns to generate personalized laptop recommendations. Unlike content-based filtering which focuses on item features, collaborative filtering leverages user behavior and preferences.

## Algorithms Implemented

### 1. User-Based Collaborative Filtering

**Principle**: Recommends laptops based on similar users' preferences.

**How it works**:
- Identifies users with similar rating patterns
- Finds laptops highly rated by similar users
- Generates recommendations using weighted average of ratings

**Key Features**:
- Cosine similarity and Pearson correlation for user similarity
- Configurable similarity thresholds
- Handles sparse user-item matrices

**Use Case**: Best when you have sufficient user rating data and want to leverage collective user preferences.

### 2. Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

**Principle**: Recommends laptops similar to previously liked items.

**How it works**:
- Computes similarity between laptops based on user rating patterns
- For a user, finds items similar to their highly-rated laptops
- Generates recommendations using item similarity scores

**Key Features**:
- Item similarity matrices for fast recommendation generation
- Handles cold-start problems better than user-based approaches
- More stable recommendations over time

**Use Case**: Effective when you have many ratings per item and want to find similar products.

### 3. Matrix Factorization

**Principle**: Decomposes user-item interaction matrix into latent factors.

**Methods Implemented**:
- **NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization)**: Ensures non-negative factors, good for rating data
- **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)**: Traditional matrix decomposition approach

**How it works**:
- Reduces high-dimensional user-item matrix to lower-dimensional latent space
- Each user and item is represented by a vector of latent factors
- Recommendations generated by computing dot product of user and item vectors

**Key Features**:
- Configurable number of latent factors
- Handles missing values and sparse data
- Captures complex user-item interactions

**Use Case**: Best for large datasets with many users and items, captures latent preferences.

### 4. Hybrid Collaborative Filtering

**Principle**: Combines multiple collaborative filtering methods for better results.

**How it works**:
- Runs all three methods (user-based, item-based, matrix factorization)
- Combines scores using configurable weights
- Provides diverse and robust recommendations

**Key Features**:
- Configurable method weights
- Combines strengths of different approaches
- Reduces bias from single methods

**Use Case**: When you want the most robust recommendations combining multiple approaches.

    'similarity_methods': {
        'min_common_items': 2,     # Minimum items for user similarity
        'min_common_users': 2,     # Minimum users for item similarity
        'similarity_threshold': 0.1 # Minimum similarity for recommendations
    },
    'recommendation_options': {
        'min_rating_threshold': 3.0,    # Minimum rating for recommendations
        'max_recommendations': 10,      # Maximum recommendations per method
        'diversity_weight': 0.3         # Weight for diversity vs similarity
    }
}
```

### Customization

You can customize the configuration by passing a custom config dictionary:

```python
custom_config = {
    'matrix_factorization': {
        'n_components': 100,  # More latent factors
        'max_iter': 500       # More iterations
    },
    'similarity_methods': {
        'min_common_items': 5,  # Higher threshold for more reliable similarities
        'similarity_threshold': 0.2  # Higher similarity threshold
    }
}

cf = CollaborativeFiltering(df_laptop, df_rating, custom_config)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from collaborative_filtering import create_collaborative_filtering

# Create collaborative filtering instance
cf = create_collaborative_filtering(df_laptop, df_rating)

# Get user-based recommendations
user_recs = cf.get_user_based_recommendations(user_id=1, n_recommendations=5)

# Get item-based recommendations
item_recs = cf.get_item_based_recommendations(user_id=1, n_recommendations=5)

# Get matrix factorization recommendations
mf_recs = cf.get_matrix_factorization_recommendations(user_id=1, n_recommendations=5)

# Get hybrid recommendations
hybrid_recs = cf.get_hybrid_recommendations(user_id=1, n_recommendations=5)
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
# Custom configuration
config = {
    'matrix_factorization': {
        'n_components': 100,
        'method': 'nmf'  # or 'svd'
    },

## Integration with Main System

### In LaptopRecommenderSystem

The collaborative filtering module is integrated into the main system:

```python
from Laptop_Recommender_System import create_laptop_recommender_system

# Create main system
recommender = create_laptop_recommender_system()

# Get collaborative filtering recommendations
cf_recs = recommender.get_collaborative_filtering_recommendations(
    user_id=1,
    method='hybrid',
    n_recommendations=5
)

# Get hybrid recommendations (combining content-based and collaborative)
hybrid_recs = recommender.get_hybrid_recommendations(
    user_id=1,
    preferences={'search_terms': ['gaming']},
    n_recommendations=5
)
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage

- **User-item matrix**: O(users × items) memory
- **Similarity matrices**: O(users² + items²) memory
- **Matrix factorization**: O(users × factors + items × factors) memory

### Computation Time

- **Similarity computation**: O(users² × items + items² × users)
- **Matrix factorization**: O(users × items × factors × iterations)
- **Recommendation generation**: O(users + items) per recommendation

### Optimization Tips

1. **Filter sparse data**: Use `min_common_items` and `min_common_users` to reduce matrix size
2. **Limit factors**: Use appropriate `n_components` for matrix factorization
3. **Batch processing**: Process recommendations in batches for large datasets
4. **Caching**: Cache similarity matrices and factorized matrices

## Evaluation Metrics

### Recommendation Quality

- **Precision@K**: Fraction of recommended items that are relevant
- **Recall@K**: Fraction of relevant items that are recommended
- **NDCG**: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain for ranking quality

### Diversity and Coverage

## Limitations and Challenges

### Cold Start Problem

- **New Users**: No rating history for recommendations
- **New Items**: Insufficient ratings for similarity computation
- **Mitigation**: Combine with content-based filtering

### Sparsity

- **Sparse Data**: Most user-item pairs have no ratings
- **Impact**: Reduces similarity computation accuracy
- **Mitigation**: Use appropriate similarity thresholds and minimum common ratings

### Scalability
